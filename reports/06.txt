> Diffusion restriction focus at right corona radiata and right parietal lobe. Recent embolic infarction was suggested.
> T2WI high signal intensity with suspicious diffusion restriction at right frontal and insular lobe. Subacute ischemic infarction cannot be ruled out.
> Loss of flow related enhancement of right internal carotid artery. Occlusion was suggested.
> Fetal type bilateral posterior cerebral artery. Hypoplasia of P1 segment of bilateral posterior cerebral artery should be considered.
> The cortical sulci and ventricular systems were symmetric in appearance and not dilated.
> No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
> No obvious midline shifting.
> Mucosal thickening of right maxillary sinus, sinusitis was suggested.
