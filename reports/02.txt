- Bulging of the C3/4 intervertebral disc
- Diffuse disc extrusion of the C4/5, C5/6 and C6/7 intervertebral discs with thickening of the posterior longitudinal ligament causing mild to moderate narrowing of the spinal canal. The bilateral neuroforamens from C4/5 to C6/7 are suspiciously encroached.
- The signal intensity of the spinal cord is essentially normal.
- Kyphotic curve of the cervical spine.


Additional information:
- ADC/DWI of brain is done due to clinician's request: No diffusion restriction lesion can be identified.
- DWI/ADC sequence can only detect diffusion restriction, advise formal cerebral MRI if clinically indicated.
