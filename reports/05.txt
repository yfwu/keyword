A 3.4 x 3 x 2.4 cm heterogeneous intra-axial mass lesion at right fronto-parietal area, with hypointensity on T1WI, iso- to hyperintensity on T2WI, shows marked perifocal edema, and central hemorrhagic foci and cystic areas. The post-contrast images show irregular peripheral thick wall and nodular enhancement. Mild water restriction is noted at the enhancing component. The lesion causes mild mass effect, compression to the anterior horn of right lateral ventricle, and midline shifts to left. Mild vasogenic edema is also noted at right thalamus, right frontal base, and right temporal region. High-grade glioma, such as glioblastoma (GBM) is suspected. DDx: metastasis.

MRA shows no evidence of occlusion or high grade stenosis over intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery and basilar artery, and main trunk of the bilateral anterior cerebral arteries and middle cerebral arteries.
