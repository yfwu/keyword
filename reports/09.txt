1. A lobulated mass lesion arising from Rt humeral proximal shaft to neck, around 3.9 cm x 2.6 cm (axial plane) x 5.8 cm (proximal-distal) of diameter range, occupying the bone marrow. Bone destruction with transcortical invasion to adjacent soft tissue, complicated with pathological fracture.
2. Also many PDFS-hyperintense bone marrow lesions in the humeral head, scapular glenoid, acromion and distal clavicle.
3. DDx multiple bone metastases vs multiple myeloma vs intraosseous lymphoma vs etc. However, in need of clinical correlation.
